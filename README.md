Malaria Atlas Project work for Imperial College relating to the updated Global Technical Strategy for Malaria.

This small repository includes scripts that determine a target ITN nets-per-capita value given a target ITN use, utilizing ITN coverage results from the Malaria Atlas Project. The results in the "data" folder are from the ITN cube labeled "20200801_final_for_wmr2020". This work was requested by Dr. Peter Winskill of Imperial College as part of his team's updated edition of the Global Techincal Strategy for Malaria.
